============

Some Python scripts I wrote after cracking the shits with Excel while
preparing a profit-loss summary of option trades for my tax return.  Got to
the point where I was like, "screw spreadsheets, I'll write some scripts to
do this stuff instead!"  And here they are, in all their hacky quick and
dirty goodness.

The initial problem these scripts were written to solve was this:

The option broker's trading platform provides an export of historical trade
transactions (buys, sells, expiry, exercise) as a csv file.  I want to know
the profit/loss of each "trade" (i.e. match up the buys and sells,
calculate profit/loss).  Apart from the tedious and repetitive point and
clickyness of doing this in a spreadsheet, I was getting frustrated by
Excel's remarkable ability to find unique and unexpected ways to mangle the
data each step of the way.  So I decided to write scripts (and use unix
tools) to do as much processing of the data as possible (as automatically
as possible) without going anywhere near a spreadsheet until the very end
(and then only for formatting).  If nothing else it was an interesting
exercise in Python programming and SQLAlchemy.

(It goes without saying these scripts come with no warranty, are not fit
for any purpose whatsoever, and using them may cause a rift in the
spaceâ€“time continuum, unleashing hordes of Lovecraftian hell-beasts
hell-bent on the destruction of humanity.  Consider yourself warned.  They
served the purpose I wanted at the time, and some of the code -- once
cleaned up and actually "tested" -- may end up as part of a
trading/portfolio management application I'm slowly hacking away on, but at
this stage nothing here is even close to production quality, or any but the
loosest definition of "quality".  For various reasons I am deliberately
going to avoid mentioning the broker in question all this relates to.)


Usage
-----

The csv data file from the broker ("activity.csv") has the following fields:

	Symbol, Description, Action, Quantity, Price, Commission, Reg Fees, Date, TransactionID, Order Number, Transaction Type ID, Total Cost

The "Date" field is actually a date-time field in US format: MM/DD/YYYY hh:mm:ss AM/PM

No matter what I tried, and despite much dicking around with the Text
Import Wizard, I could not get Excel to parse that properly and reformat it
for my locale (Australia) as DD/MM/YYYY hh:mm:ss AM/PM.

This was my initial motivation for giving up on Excel and writing scripts
instead.  Hence the first script, designed to fix this, csv_us2au_date.py:

	./csv_us2au_date.py activity.csv activity_datefixed.csv 7

The broker data is in reverse chronological order.  The scripts assume it's
in chronological order, so needs to be reversed:

	tac activity_datefixed.csv > activity_datefixed_rev.csv

So now we have sane input data.  

First we create a database (sqlite for now):

	./models.py

Then import our sanitised data file:

	./import_activity.py activity_datefixed_rev.csv 

Now we can analyse the data and get some profit/loss calculations going:

	./gen_trades.py 

Finally, the money shot (so to speak).  Generate output csv files with
profit/loss calculations for each trade:

	./export_trades.py ProfitLoss

This will generate two output files, ProfitLoss_raw_events.csv and
ProfitLoss_format_events.csv.  They both present the same data in slightly
different ways.  Both files are suitable for loading in a spreadsheet for
final tweaking.
